# ESS 563 Final Project Assignment – *Theoretical Seismology I*

**Submission Deadline:** *Wednesday, December 10, 2025*  

## Overview

For your final project in ESS 563, you will conduct a short **individual research project** applying concepts from theoretical seismology. This project is time-efficient (to be completed in about 10 days) and culminates in two main deliverables: a **4–6 page mini research paper** and a **presentation** (a recorded 10-minute video and a live in-class presentation). The goal is to explore a seismic source topic of your choice, analyze real data, and demonstrate the methods learned in class. This assignment will test your ability to integrate theory with practical data analysis and communicate your findings clearly.

## Project Guidelines

1. **Choose a Topic within Course Themes**
   Select a focused research question or case study related to the themes we covered in class. Possible areas include: earthquake source characterization, source-time functions, moment tensor inversion, slow-slip events, supershear rupture, finite fault modeling, etc. Choose a topic that genuinely interests you and is appropriately scoped for a short project.

2. **Retrieve Real Seismic Data**
   Your project must incorporate real seismic data. Use open data services such as the IRIS DMC/FDSN web services or other public databases. Document event IDs, station codes, time ranges, and ensure data quality.

3. **Apply Course Methods/Tools**
   Demonstrate use of one or two methods introduced during the course, e.g.:

   * Stress or strain tensor calculations
   * Radiation pattern simulations
   * Moment tensor inversion (e.g. MTUQ)
   * Full-waveform modeling (SPECFEM3D)
   * Source spectral analysis
   * Seismo-Live or Python notebooks

4. **Maintain a Manageable Scope**
   Keep your project focused. Aim to analyze one event or dataset in depth rather than attempting a broad survey.

5. **Original Work and Citations**
   The analysis and writing should be your own. Cite all tools, resources, datasets, and software (including AI if used).

## Written Report Requirements (4–6 Pages)

Your written report should be structured like a mini research paper:

* **Title and Author**

* **Abstract (150–250 words)**

* **Introduction**

  * Context and literature review
  * Research question and motivation

* **Data and Methods**

  * Seismic event details
  * Data sources and access methods
  * Methods applied and tools used

* **Results**

  * Include figures and tables
  * Interpretations linked to the research question

* **Discussion**

  * Broader implications
  * Uncertainties and limitations
  * Sensitivity tests or parameter analysis

* **Conclusions**

* **References** (in standard citation style)

Include properly labeled figures, clear captions, and refer to them in your text.

## Deliverables

Submit the following:

1. **PDF of the Written Report**

   * Filename: `ESS563_FinalProject_[YourLastName].pdf`

2. **10-Minute Recorded Presentation**

   * Summarize research in 8–12 slides
   * Save in a common format (e.g., MP4)

3. **Presentation Slides**

   * PDF or PPT format for in-class use
   * Filename: `ESS563_FinalProject_Slides_[YourLastName].pptx`

4. **GitHub Repository**

   * Create a public GitHub repository containing your project code
   * Use a standard Python project template structure
   * Include:
     - `README.md` with project description and instructions
     - `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` for dependencies
     - Well-organized code with clear documentation
     - Data access scripts or instructions
     - Jupyter notebooks if applicable
   * Ensure reproducibility: someone should be able to clone and run your analysis
   * Repository URL: `https://github.com/[YourUsername]/ESS563_FinalProject`
